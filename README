HiPack

This is a copy of PHP's pack/unpack function made into a nodejs module.
Its a 100% clone with an additional options.

* A new feature where we can populate an existing Buffer is now there, so
* the caller can
worry about Buffer management. Simply make the first parameter a buffer

* Also we can supply an array of values, rather than arguments, so the 2nd
* parameter is an array.
ie. pack( "VV", [ 23,55 ] );

* Added a Perl style format that was missing, which is format character "V"
* and "v"
