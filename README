This is a copy of PHP's pack function made into a nodejs module.
Its a 100% clone with no new features or changed features, yet.

The only speed issue is that doing a Buffer::New() takes a long time.

I will add a feature where we can populate an existing Buffer, so the caller can
worry about Buffer management. This will be done as the first paramater. The feature
is there, but it doesnt work yet because of some type casting errors going from an
arg[n] v8:Object to v8:Buffer or node::Buffer, once thats fixed its good.
